- [ ] Manage departments and positions
- [ ] Generate reports
- [ ] Export functionality
- [ ] Bulk operations

## Known Issues üêõ

### Critical
- **External API Empty Responses**: The fingerprint system API at http://tco.aqnietgroup.com:5555/v1 returns empty arrays for all endpoints. May require authentication or proper configuration.

### Minor
- **Time Zone Handling**: Times are stored in UTC but display conversion needs refinement
- **Work Schedule Logic**: Currently using hardcoded 9:00-18:00 schedule
- **Absence Detection**: Needs more sophisticated logic for weekends/holidays

### UI/UX
- Calendar navigation could be improved with month/year selectors
- Loading states need better visual feedback
- Mobile responsiveness needs testing

## Technical Debt üí≥

1. **Error Handling**: Need comprehensive error handling across all API endpoints
2. **Testing**: No automated tests implemented
3. **Documentation**: API documentation needs to be generated
4. **Security**: Implement proper authentication tokens
5. **Performance**: Add caching for frequently accessed data
6. **Logging**: Implement proper logging system

## Database State

### Tables Created:
- `departments` - Organizational structure
- `positions` - Job positions
- `employees` - Employee records with test data
- `time_events` - Raw check-in/out events
- `time_records` - Processed attendance records
- `work_schedules` - Work schedule templates (empty)
- `users` - System users for authentication

### Test Data Available:
- 5 departments with hierarchical structure
- 8 position types
- 10 employees with full information
- Time events for May 2025
- Admin user (admin/admin123)

## Next Steps üöÄ

### Immediate Priority:
1. Investigate external API authentication requirements
2. Implement work schedule functionality
3. Add report generation features
4. Improve absence tracking logic

### Short Term (1-2 weeks):
1. Complete admin panel CRUD operations
2. Add data export functionality
3. Implement email notifications
4. Create API documentation

### Long Term (1+ month):
1. Mobile application development
2. Advanced analytics and reporting
3. Integration with HR systems
4. Multi-language support

## Environment Configuration

### Development Setup:
```bash
Backend: http://localhost:3030
Frontend: http://localhost:5555
Database: ./backend/hr_tracker.db
```

### External Dependencies:
- Node.js v14+
- SQLite3
- Python 3 (for frontend server)
- Access to fingerprint system API (currently not functional)

## Testing Credentials

### Employee Login:
- Personnel Number: –ê–ü00-00358
- Name: –°—É–∏–Ω–¥–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞ –°–∞–π—Ä–∞—à –ê–≥–∞–±–µ–∫–æ–≤–Ω–∞
- Has test data for May 2025

### Admin Login:
- Username: admin
- Password: admin123

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Database**: Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL for production
2. **Authentication**: Implement JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
3. **API Security**: Add rate limiting and request validation
4. **Monitoring**: Set up application monitoring and alerting
5. **Backup**: Implement automated database backups
6. **SSL**: Configure HTTPS for all endpoints
